# CraigslistBrowser
A project in Scala using Jsoupe (and later ScalaNLP) to retrieve local craiglist postings and parse the information into meaningful categories. The idea is that using the posted price and leveraging any additional information (text description, image posting, post information, etc.) to determine if it is a "good" deal.
